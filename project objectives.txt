I am working on Analyzing the data scraped from the website petfinder.com.  I scraped data of cats up for adoption within 25 miles of New York City.  My objective is to determine the differences between cats up for adoption for 30 days plus and cats up for adoption for less than 30 days.  This information will be helpful to rescue groups, shelters and individuals who put cats up for adoption on the site.  I'm trying to glean insights to help them get cats adopted quicker and also things that may save them time.  Many of them are volunteers.
