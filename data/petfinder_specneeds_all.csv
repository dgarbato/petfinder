Benzene,3,0,Adult,Domestic Short Hair & Tiger Mix,Tabby (Tiger Striped),Medium,Female,,,Yes,"Vaccinations up to date, spayed / neutered, special needs. Last October 2020, this darlin’ little girl was found emaciated outside of a Philadelphia ( Science) university dorm ( thus the name Benzene)! A compassionate student took her in and sent her home to her mom in New Jersey. From there she received veterinary care and was nursed back to a healthy weight. She is however on thyroid medication which she takes twice a day morning and night. She takes it extremely easily when wrapped in a treat. The vet said that her age is unknown putting her at age 8 or older. She is extremely cuddly and her fur is exceptionally soft unlike any other cat her foster home has seen. Her legs, especially her front legs, appear to be shorter than the average cat which makes her even more adorable. Somewhere along the line she may have been mixed with the Napoleon cat breed. She thrives on being an only cat and seems rather stressed when too many other animals are around. Although friendly and loving with all we’ve noticed a slight preference for men. If you’re looking for a companion and a cuddle buddy, please consider giving this girl your loving home.
