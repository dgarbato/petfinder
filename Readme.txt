The data for this project was scraped from petfinder.com

The objective of my project is to provide petfinder.com rescue groups and shelters with information that they can use to better "market" their cats and improve adoption rates.

The code used to scrape the data is in the "scraping code" folder.

The remainder of the code is in the "juypter notebook code" folder.

The read_petfinder 1 notebook reads in and cleans up the scraped data.

The Analyze data 1 notebook reads in data created above, 
	- further up data and prepares it for analysis.
	- contains an analysis of duplicate records.(includes graphs)
	- exports a file with the duplicates removed 

The Duplicaates Removed Analyze and Graph notebook analyzes the data with duplicates removed and creates additional graphs
