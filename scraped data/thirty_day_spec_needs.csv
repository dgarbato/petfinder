Lady Doe is an FIV+ cat - but do NOT worry. She will live a long, happy, healthy life just like any non-FIV cat with proper care. That just means she must be in an indoor only home, and make sure she goes to her annual vet visits. FAQ: FIV CANNOT be spread to other species. FIV can only be spread to other cats through deep bite wounds and reproduction. FIV weakens the immune system, so keep cat indoors ONLY. A FIV cat can live as long and healthy of a life as a non-FIV cat as long as you are diligent about their medical care (as you should be for a non-FIV cat, too, TBH).

A compassionate student took her in and sent her home to her mom in New Jersey. From there she received veterinary care and was nursed back to a healthy weight. She is however on thyroid medication which she takes twice a day morning and night. She takes it extremely easily when wrapped in a treat. The vet said that her age is unknown putting her at age 8 or older. She is extremely cuddly and her fur is exceptionally soft unlike any other cat her foster home has seen. Her legs, especially her front legs, appear to be shorter than the average cat which makes her even more adorable. Somewhere along the line she may have been mixed with the Napoleon cat breed. She thrives on being an only cat and seems rather stressed when too many other animals are around. Although friendly and loving with all we’ve noticed a slight preference for men.

He is in great condition, perhaps a little chubby, but is in excellent health. RUSTY needs a great home where he will have excellent nutrition and care. FIV cats can live a normal life. The only way FIV is transmitted is when saliva enters the bloodstream via a bite wound. RUSTY is demure and sweet. He has been at NFFAR for over a year and has never had a scuffle with another cat.
